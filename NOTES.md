# Notes
## Implementation

Please describe your plan for how to implement data fetching and persistent data
storage for A Star Wars Experience.
How are you going to fetch and display the data from remote APIs? How are you
going to store and recall which movies were watched across sessions? Etc.

## Limitations, Future Work

Describe what shortcomings or flaws exist in the version you are submitting.
Nothing is ever perfect and we expect some things to be left unfinished - it's
important to be able to recognize those issues so we can come back and fix them
later.
